## Project Description

This is a video call application that allows users to talk and connect through just their browser. The application includes real time text chat functionality and voice chat has a variety of features like sharing screens, muting/deafening mics, and facecam.
It's also a modern PWA (Progressive Web App) so users can install it on their devices like other native apps.
